# DrawBasicShapes

Drawing basic shapes and lines in C++ with SFML and ImGui,
trying out different algorithms on how to do it.

Currently realized algorithms are:

- Circle midpoint;
- Ellipse midpoint;
- Bezier curve
- Object movement with matrix
- Object rotations with matrix
- Object scaling with matrix
